# PROJECT: 

Lightweight Track Builder (Rewrite of Templot by Martin Wynne)

## GOAL:

Create a minimal Python-based engine to generate accurate model railway track, focusing on straight track and simple turnouts for 3D printing (STL export). The project will adhere to bullhead rail standards based on REA specifications, with chairs and timbers included. This MVP will serve as the foundation for a more comprehensive track design tool.

## KEY INSIGHTS:

- Legacy dxf_unit.pas (Pascal) code is pivotal, containing both 2D DXF and 3D STL export logic.
- The codebase is monolithic, heavily reliant on global variables for rail/sleeper geometry, tolerances, and more.
- Decades of incremental updates have resulted in intertwined 2D and 3D logic under "DXF" routines.

## MVP PLAN:

- Build the MVP using **FastAPI** for its performance, API-first design, and type validation capabilities.
- Create an admin panel using FastAPI-compatible tools or a lightweight database editor.
- Focus on bullhead rail based on REA standards.
- Include chairs as part of the 3D model, as the rail sits within the chairs.
- Design track as a combination of:
  - **Timbers:** Base structure for the track.
  - **Chairs:** Components to hold the rail.
  - **Rail:** Added manually by the user post-3D printing.
- Implement functionality to generate a straight piece of track to the user’s specified length.
- Use Python CAD libraries (e.g., CadQuery) for STL file generation.
- Introduce a SQLite database to remove hardcoded data, enabling flexible storage of track parameters and configurations.
- **Validate STL file integrity** using lightweight checks (e.g., watertightness) and provide basic feedback if validation fails.
- Note: **Mesh inspection and repair** is not included in the MVP but is planned as a future enhancement.

## WORKING ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:

- The project will be developed using VS Code on a Windows laptop.
- GitHub Desktop will be used for version management.
- Instructions will provide explicit steps, including details on where files should be placed within the directory structure to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.
- CLI will be windows Command Prompt.

## REFACTORING OUTLINE:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Replace global variables with structured classes (e.g., `TrackSettings`).
- **Database Integration:** Replace hardcoded values with dynamic retrieval from the SQLite database for better configurability and scalability.
- **Geometry/Math Decoupling:** Keep core logic in a separate module, independent of UI/CLI.
- **Native 3D Export:** Leverage Python CAD libraries to directly generate STL geometry.
- **Modular Design:** Ensure the application is modular to support the addition of advanced workflows (e.g., mesh repair and inspection) in the future.
- **Track Element Modularity:** Ensure timbers, chairs, and rail are modularly designed for reusability and scalability.

## ATTRIBUTION:
To comply with GNU GPLv3, include prominent attribution in the code comments and documentation to Martin Wynne for his original work on Templot.

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

- Add more track types, turnout angles, and advanced details (e.g., snap-fit designs) once the MVP is stable.
- Expand REA-based models with additional variations and regional standards.
- Introduce an **optional mesh inspection and repair workflow**, allowing users to:
  - Inspect STL files for issues (e.g., non-watertight surfaces, inverted normals).
  - Generate a report detailing identified problems.
  - Apply automated repairs or skip repairs based on user preference.
- Include user-selectable parameters, such as **checkboxes** to skip inspection or repair for external workflows.
- Reintroduce specialized features like chaired track and snap-fit designs after validating the core engine.

## END STATE:

A FastAPI-based, modular, and maintainable track design engine that generates STL files for REA-standard bullhead rail track, including chairs and timbers, supported by a SQLite database for flexible data management. The rail itself is intended to be added manually by the user after 3D printing.
